Day 1: June 14, 2025
Overview
Kicked off the hack-the-code journey with Hello World programs in C, C++, Go, and Python to establish basic syntax and setup for hacking-focused challenges.
Challenges

Implemented Hello World in four languages to understand their basic structure and output mechanisms.

Solutions



Language
File Path
Description
Run Command



C
c/hello_world.c
Basic printf usage
gcc c/hello_world.c -o hello_c && ./hello_c


C++
cpp/hello_world.cpp
std::cout output
g++ cpp/hello_world.cpp -o hello_cpp && ./hello_cpp


Go
go/hello_world.go
fmt.Println usage
go run go/hello_world.go


Python
python/hello_world.py
print function
python python/hello_world.py


Learnings

C: Mastered printf and basic program structure for low-level hacking.
C++: Explored std::cout and iostream for object-oriented programming.
Go: Understood fmt.Println and Go’s package system for network tools.
Python: Learned print and Python’s simplicity for scripting and CTFs.

Next Steps

Dive into C pointers and Python scripting for hacking challenges.
Start LeetCode with easy problems (e.g., Two Sum) in all languages.
