# Hack-The-Code Journey ðŸš€

**A 6-Month Personal Roadmap for Mastering Coding, Ethical Hacking, Cybersecurity, and System Programming**

---

## ðŸ§  Purpose

This repository documents my self-paced 6-month intensive learning journey into:

- Ethical Hacking & Cybersecurity
- Low-Level Programming (C, C++, Assembly)
- Algorithms & Data Structures
- Python Scripting & Automation
- Capture The Flag (CTF), Bug Bounties, and Security Research

---

## âš™ Tech Stack & Tools

- **Languages:** C, C++, Python, Go, Bash
- **Security Tools:** Burp Suite, Wireshark, Nmap, Metasploit, Ghidra, IDA Free, GDB
- **CTF Platforms:** HackTheBox, TryHackMe, PicoCTF
- **Version Control:** Git & GitHub
- **IDEs:** VSCode, Vim

---

## ðŸ§­ 6-Month Learning Roadmap

### Month 1 â€” Foundations & Setup
- Setup development environment
- Master basic syntax: C, C++, Go, Python
- Learn compilation, debugging, and version control
- Understand project structuring, repositories, and Git branching

### Month 2 â€” Low-Level Programming (C Focused)
- C memory management (stack, heap, pointers, malloc/free)
- Buffer overflows (basic)
- Compile-time vs Runtime errors
- Start working with `GDB` for debugging

### Month 3 â€” Algorithms & Problem Solving
- Start solving LeetCode challenges (Easy to Medium)
- Implement data structures: Arrays, Linked Lists, Stacks, Queues, Trees, Hash Tables
- Study time complexity (Big O analysis)
- Solve problems across multiple languages

### Month 4 â€” Python Scripting & Automation
- File parsing, web scraping, API automation
- Build small hacking scripts
- Develop custom CLI tools using Python & Bash
- Automate repetitive tasks (web scanning, port scanning)

### Month 5 â€” Ethical Hacking & Security Core
- OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities
- Web exploitation basics (SQLi, XSS, CSRF, IDOR)
- Network scanning & packet sniffing (Nmap, Wireshark)
- Reverse engineering basics (disassembly, dynamic analysis)
- Binary exploitation (buffer overflow, ROP chains intro)

### Month 6 â€” Real-World Practice & CTFs
- Build personal hacking tools & scripts
- Participate in CTF challenges (HackTheBox, TryHackMe, PicoCTF)
- Start beginner bug bounty programs
- Create detailed write-ups and reports for learning documentation

## ðŸ“Š Current Focus

> Ethical Hacking & Cybersecurity

I am already actively studying:
- Web application hacking
- Linux privilege escalation
- Buffer overflow exploitation
- CTF challenges (HackTheBox & TryHackMe)
