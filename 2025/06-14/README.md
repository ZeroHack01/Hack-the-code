# Hack The Code: Day 1 â€” June 14, 2025

## Overview

Kicked off the **Hack-the-Code** journey with `Hello World` programs in C, C++, Go, and Python. The goal was to establish basic syntax familiarity and prepare the environment for upcoming hacking-focused challenges.

---

## Challenges

- Implemented `Hello World` in four languages.
- Focused on understanding each language's basic structure, syntax, and output mechanisms.

---

## Solutions

| Language | File Path         | Description       | Run Command |
| -------- | ----------------- | ------------------ | ------------ |
| **C**     | `c/hello_world.c`   | Basic `printf` usage | `gcc c/hello_world.c -o hello_c && ./hello_c` |
| **C++**   | `cpp/hello_world.cpp` | `std::cout` output | `g++ cpp/hello_world.cpp -o hello_cpp && ./hello_cpp` |
| **Go**    | `go/hello_world.go`  | `fmt.Println` usage | `go run go/hello_world.go` |
| **Python**| `python/hello_world.py` | `print` function | `python python/hello_world.py` |

---

## Learnings

- **C:** Mastered `printf()` and basic program structure â€” essential for low-level hacking and binary exploitation.
- **C++:** Practiced `std::cout` and `iostream` â€” laying foundation for object-oriented and system-level programming.
- **Go:** Understood `fmt.Println()` and Goâ€™s package structure â€” valuable for building network tools and concurrent programs.
- **Python:** Leveraged `print()` and explored Pythonâ€™s simplicity â€” perfect for scripting, automation, and CTF problem-solving.

---

## Next Steps

- Deep dive into **C pointers** and **Python scripting** for exploit development and automation.
- Start solving LeetCode problems (e.g., **Two Sum**) in all languages to build multi-language fluency.
- Set up version control and CI for future projects.
